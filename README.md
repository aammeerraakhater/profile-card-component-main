## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.


**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Was to set the background like in the image it now looks good in desktop, but still need improvments in smaller screens, also i used card from bootstrap so there is a little white border around the background
